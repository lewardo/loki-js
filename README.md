# A vanilla javascript version of [loki-vue](https://www.github.com/lewardo/loki-vue)
## simple website employing Alpine, anime.js and DOMtastic

to run navigate to `./server` and run

```bash
npm install -g nodemon; npm install; npm start
```

Node 14.17.3^ LTS required (or equivalent), npm version 7.20.0^, uses Express version 4.17.1 (tested with versions named) and Nodemon to serve over port 80 on `localhost`
See Docker images for running in container (not yet uploaded to docker hub)

Can also serve file `file://` protocol, since this is a static website, but server routing is always recommended!
